# Change Calculator
> Calculate change due. Separated in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

This was my second project at Origin Code Academy. This Change Calculator was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and JavaScript.

## Approach

I took a mobile first approach with this project (as I try to do with all projects, when feasible!) and thus I wanted the design to be minimal with the focus on the functionality of this app.

## Installation

Download all associated files and load them up in your favorite text editor!

## Development setup

This app relies on jQuery and Javascript for its functionality and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for its design. To run the calcuator use a simple static server.

```sh
npm i -g node-static
// cd to-your-web-folder
static
```
